## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7
One of my favorite labs we've had done this whole semester is lab 7 where we had to write function to let us know what time we can and cannot park on a street. It was fun to write the schedule in code and use military time.

Lab 3, Part 1
Another lab I really enjoyed was lab 3 part-1 where we had to input different information to find the BMR for men and women. Inputting different statistics of averages gave me an idea of today's society, and more about the human body.

lab 9, Part 1
My last lab I really enjoyed working on is lab 9 part-1 where I helped create an algorithm where it points out misspelled words and points them out for the person writing tofix it. That is something I find very useful because I use that often in the real world.
